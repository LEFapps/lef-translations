# Translations/CMS

Meteor React package for translations and CMS.

## Installation

Git clone this repository into your projects `packages` folder and `meteor add lef:translations`.

## Wrapper

Use the HOC to wrap your application, or at least the parts that need translations. Use the settings to layout some ground rules.

```JSX
import { Translator } from 'meteor/lef:translations'

const languageSettings = {
  languages: ['nl', 'fr'],
  default: 'nl'
}

<Translator settings={languageSettings}>
  // your app code
</Translator>
```

## Text component

Use the `<Translate />` React component to insert text in the app. Editing the translation is possible by double clicking on it while logged in as admin. Optionally use `md` to set as a textfield (with markdown support). Set `getString` to only get the translation string returned. Default a `<span>` will be returned. Optionally use the `category` prop to classify translations and make the admin overview clearer.

```JSX
import { Translate } from 'meteor/lef:translations'

<Translate _id='welcome_message' md category='home' />
```

## Admin component

Insert the `<Translations />` React component in an admin interface to edit all translations. Make sure the user has the `'admin'` role set in their user account.

## Pick language menu

This creates a bootstrap uncontrolled dropdown menu for use in a `nav` element.

```JSX
import { PickLanguage } from 'meteor/lef:translations'

<PickLanguage />
```

## withTranslator

If for some reason you need the current language settings or want to change some of them you can use `withTranslator`.

```JSX
import { withTranslator } from 'meteor/lef:translations'

const Component = ({translator}) => {
  return (
    <p>This is the current language: {translator.currentLanguage}</p>
    <button onClick={() => translator.setCurrentLanguage('nl')}>
      Set current language to NL
    </button>
  )
}

const ComponentContainer = withTranslator(Component)
```

`translator` looks usually like this:
```JS
const translator = {
  currentLanguage: 'nl',
  default: 'nl',
  languages: ['nl', 'fr', 'en'],
  setCurrentLanguage: function(lang) {},
  user: {} /* current user â€“ when logged in */
}
```
